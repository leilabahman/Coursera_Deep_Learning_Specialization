# Coursera_Deep_Learning_Specialization

This repository contains my work on Coursera "Deep Learning Specialization" programming assignments. All code bases, formulas, and images are from unless specified, Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (by Andrew Ng).

There are five courses in this specialization. Currently, the first two  courses are on this repository.
