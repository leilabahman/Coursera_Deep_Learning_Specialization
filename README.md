# Coursera_Deep_Learning_Specialization

This repository contains my work on Coursera "Deep Learning Specialization" programming assignments. All code bases, formulas, and images are from unless specified, Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (by Andrew Ng).

There are five courses in this specialization. Currently, the first two  courses are on this repository:

# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Week 1
 * Introduction to Deep Learning
* Week 2
 * Logistic Regression as a Neural Network
 * Python and Vectorization
* Week 3
 * Shallow neural networks
* Week 4
 * Deep Neural Networks
# Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
* Week 1
 * Practical aspects of Deep Learning
  * Setting up your Machine Learning Application
  * Regularizing your neural network
  * Setting up your optimization problem
* Week 2
 * Optimization algorithms
* Week3
 * Hyperparameter tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks
